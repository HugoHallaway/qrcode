# QR Code Creator
Simple Python code for create QR Code.


You can adjust the file how you want.
For this, You can replace "img" by the word you want ! And replace the URL of course !
So, you have just to put your word at the 'img' place, at the first and seconde line !

To run it, open in terminal the floder, and : python3 filename.py

So the default is : 


img = qrcode.make('www.youtube.com')

img.show()


But you can transform it to :

polka = qrcode.make('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yh9i0PAjck')

polka.show()


So modify as you want and have fun ! Share it to your friend !
